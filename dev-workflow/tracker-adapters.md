# Tracker adapters — the provider seam

The skills and the autonomous loop never talk to a tracker directly. They
talk in **canonical verbs**, and a thin per-provider adapter maps each verb
onto that tracker's API. Today there is one implementation — **Linear**, via
its MCP server — but every skill is written against the verbs below, not
against Linear, so a second provider is a new mapping table, not a rewrite.

**One hard rule: state and label names always come from `tracker.roles` in
`dev-workflow.yml`.** A skill must never hardcode `agent`, `Todo`, `Done`,
`agent-blocked`, etc. It resolves the *role* (`queue`, `blocked`, `exclude`,
`done`) to the repo's own names at runtime — read them with
`dw-config.py`, e.g. `uv run dev-workflow/dw-config.py dev-workflow.yml
tracker.roles.queue.label`. That is what lets the same skill drive two repos
whose boards use different words.

## Canonical verbs

| Verb | Inputs | Semantics |
|---|---|---|
| `list_actionable` | `roles.queue` (label + states), `roles.exclude.labels` | The work queue: tickets carrying the queue label, in one of the queue states, that carry none of the excluded labels. This is what a loop pass iterates. |
| `get_ticket` | ticket key (`ABC-123`) | Full ticket — title, description, current state, labels, comments, linked PRs. |
| `create_ticket` | title, body, `[labels]`, `[state]` | Open a new ticket (e.g. a follow-up the agent spun off). |
| `comment` | ticket key, markdown body | Append a comment — clarifying questions, answers recorded back, status notes. |
| `move` (state-role) | ticket key, **state role** (`done`, or a queue state) | Advance lifecycle by *role*, resolved to the board's state name. Never pass a literal state. |
| `label` / `unlabel` (label-role) | ticket key, **label role** (`queue`, `blocked`, an `exclude` label) | Add/remove a role's label, resolved to the board's label name. E.g. set `blocked` when a ticket needs a human; clear `queue` when done. |
| `link_pr` | ticket key, PR URL | Attach the opened PR to the ticket so the two are cross-referenced. |
| `get_blockers` | ticket key (`ABC-123`) | The tickets this one is **blocked by** — its upstream dependencies. Returns each blocker's key and current state, so a loop can check whether every blocker has reached `roles.done.state` before building the dependent ticket. Read-only; used at triage to sequence dependent work. |
| `queue_count` | `roles.queue` (label + states), `roles.exclude.labels` | Read-only count of `list_actionable`'s result set — the orchestrator's cheap pre-check. MUST share `list_actionable`'s eligibility definition (same roles, same exclude filter) so the pre-check can never silently drift from what a pass would pick up. |

## Linear mapping (the implementation today)

Linear is driven through its MCP tools (`mcp__linear__*`). Pass the **team
name** from `tracker.team` (Linear's `list_*` tools want the human team name,
not the key prefix). Names below in `roles.*` are read from `dev-workflow.yml`.

**`tracker.project` (optional) — one repo's slice of a shared team.** When
several repos share one Linear team (e.g. a multi-repo product, or a personal
team spanning hobby repos), set `tracker.project: <Linear Project name>` in each
repo's `dev-workflow.yml`. Every read/create verb then additionally scopes to
that Project, so a repo only ever sees and touches its own issues on the shared
board. Ticket **identifiers stay team-scoped** (all repos share the team's key
prefix — the Project field, not the key, distinguishes the repo). Omit
`tracker.project` and every verb is team-only, exactly as before.

| Verb | Linear MCP call | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `list_actionable` | `mcp__linear__list_issues` | Filter by `team = tracker.team`, `label = roles.queue.label`, `state ∈ roles.queue.states`, **and `project = tracker.project` when set**; then drop any issue carrying a `roles.exclude.labels` entry (filter client-side — combine as needed). |
| `get_ticket` | `mcp__linear__get_issue` | By issue id / key. |
| `create_ticket` | `mcp__linear__save_issue` | Omit the id to create; set `team`, `title`, `description`, `labels`, `state`, **and `project = tracker.project` when set** (so a new ticket lands in this repo's slice of the shared board). |
| `comment` | `mcp__linear__save_comment` | New comment on the issue. |
| `move` (state-role) | `mcp__linear__save_issue` | Update the existing issue's `state` to the name resolved from the role (e.g. `roles.done.state`). |
| `label` / `unlabel` (label-role) | `mcp__linear__save_issue` | Update the issue's `labels` set — add/remove the name resolved from the role. |
| `link_pr` | `mcp__linear__create_attachment` | Attach the PR URL to the issue. |
| `get_blockers` | `mcp__linear__get_issue` (relations) | If the MCP returns the issue's `blocked-by` relations, use them directly. **Fallback convention** (relations not cheaply readable): parse a `Blocked by: ABC-###` line — comma-separated keys allowed — from the ticket description **at triage**; zero adapter work. Either path, `get_ticket` each blocker key to read its current state. |
| `queue_count` | `dev-workflow/queue-count.py` (GraphQL over urllib, keyed by `LINEAR_API_KEY`) | Same filter as `list_actionable` (team + optional `tracker.project` + queue label + queue states, exclude labels dropped client-side); returns only the count. Not an MCP call — it must run without a Claude session. |

**Linear MCP has no delete.** The strongest teardown is moving an issue to a
`Canceled` state — never assume a hard delete exists. Anything the loop
"removes" is a state/label change, not a deletion.

## The board CLI — a read-only second seam

`dw-board` (the framework board tool) is a *second* way the framework touches the
tracker, alongside the canonical verbs. It is **read-only except for the
config-gated `prune`**: `dw-board snapshot` renders throwaway board views (what
`standup` reads), and `dw-board prune` in its default report-only mode
(`board.prune.allow_delete: false`) prints finished/stale candidates without
mutating — exactly the input the loop's weekly `🧹 Board hygiene` digest consumes.
Every *mutation* the loop performs (labeling `dep_blocked`, commenting, moving
state) still goes through the canonical verbs above, never the board CLI.

## Adding a provider

To wire a second tracker, add its name to `KNOWN_TRACKERS` in `validate.py`
and write a mapping table like the one above — implement each canonical verb,
resolving every state/label from `tracker.roles`, never hardcoding names.

**GitHub Issues sketch** (illustrative):

- **Labels → labels.** The `queue` / `blocked` / `exclude` roles map straight
  onto GitHub issue labels (`roles.queue.label` = e.g. `agent`).
- **States → open/closed + labels.** GitHub issues have only `open`/`closed`,
  so multi-step lifecycle rides on labels: the queue states become label
  presence on an open issue; `roles.done.state` maps to closing the issue
  (optionally with a `done` label). `list_actionable` = open issues with the
  queue label and without any exclude label.
- **Verbs → API.** `get_ticket` = `gh issue view`; `comment` = `gh issue
  comment`; `create_ticket` = `gh issue create`; `move`/`label` = `gh issue
  edit` (labels) or `gh issue close`; `link_pr` = a comment or the PR body's
  `Closes #N`. `get_blockers` = read the issue's task-list / tracked-by
  references or the same `Blocked by: #N` description convention, then `gh issue
  view` each blocker for its open/closed state.

Keep the shape identical to the Linear table so a skill written to the verbs
runs unchanged against either provider.
