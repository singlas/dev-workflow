# CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview

`dev-workflow` is the framework — **CI, but for ticket work.** A generic runner +
Claude Code plugin read one per-repo `dev-workflow.yml` and work your board
(pick up tickets, ask questions in team chat, open one reviewable PR each)
inside guardrails a repo can tighten but never loosen. The framework leads;
the original standalone AI-prompt collections (context files, audits,
web-optimization, handover) are demoted to `extras/`.

## Content Guidelines

- Prompts should be copy-paste ready — no customization needed for basic use
- Use `[PLACEHOLDER]` syntax for values the user must fill in
- Never ask AI to guess — instruct it to write "Unknown" if something can't be determined
- Include security defaults (credential exclusion, protected areas)
- Structure prompts as Phase 1 (Audit) → Phase 2 (Implement) where applicable
- One commit per fix pattern for implementation prompts

## Conventions

- README.md is about the framework (pitch → tiers → quickstart → how it's put
  together); the prompt collections get one short "Extras" section pointing at
  `extras/README.md` — their detail tables live THERE, not in the root README;
  keep that split when editing
- All prompts are Markdown files organized into categorized subdirectories under
  `extras/`, indexed by `extras/README.md`
- `site/` contains the HTML guide page and is not a prompt directory
- `dev-workflow/` is a real framework, not prompts: the per-repo `dev-workflow.yml`
  contract, its PyYAML validator (`validate.py` — enforces boundary rule 1,
  config can only tighten, never loosen), the dotted-path reader (`dw-config.py`),
  and the tracker-adapter seam. Keep names in sync with the ticket-loop runner
  (`skills/ticket-loop/`) and the `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (plugin name
  `dev-workflow`). New Python here must pass `python3 -m py_compile`; the
  validator has a `test_validate.py` (`python3 dev-workflow/test_validate.py`);
  the orchestrator brain and pre-check have `skills/ticket-loop/orchestrator/test_orch.py`
  and `dev-workflow/test_queue_count.py` (same `python3 <file>` idiom)
