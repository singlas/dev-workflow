# SessionStart hook for the dev-workflow plugin (Claude Code only).
#
# Purpose: when a session opens in a repo that USES dev-workflow (a dev-workflow.yml
# sits in the cwd), inject a ~5-line orientation so the session knows the skills are
# here. In every OTHER repo it must be SILENT — no output, no noise. That silence is
# the whole contract: the plugin is installed globally, but only speaks up where the
# repo has opted in with a config file.
#
# It never blocks session start: any internal hiccup exits 0 with no output.

# The one gate: no config in the cwd → stay completely silent.

# Cheap, dependency-free read of agent.enabled (the v2 local-agent opt-in). We do NOT
# shell out to uv/dw-config here — the hook must be fast and must not hard-depend on a
# Python toolchain. A tiny awk block-scan over the flat YAML is enough; anything we
# can't read confidently is reported as "unknown".

Session skills: /standup to orient on the board, /cleanup to ship a PR into the base branch, /release to promote to prod, /setup to (re)configure or check prereqs.
Everything repo-specific (tracker team/roles, branch model, test + lint commands, tightened guardrails) is read from dev-workflow.yml — never hardcode it.
Local autonomous agent tier (v2, the /ticket-loop skill): ${agent_state}.
Daily loop: /standup to start, work, /cleanup to ship. The worktree branch model lives in dev-process/README.md."
